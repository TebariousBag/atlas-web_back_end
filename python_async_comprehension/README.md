# Python - Async Comprehension
## Overview
This project introduces asynchronous comprehensions and asynchronous generators in Python. It builds on the foundations of async and await by exploring how to iterate over asynchronous data sources efficiently. Learners will implement and use async generators and comprehensions to manage streams of asynchronous data, while also applying Python's type hinting system for better code readability and reliability. This project is essential for writing scalable, non-blocking code in modern Python applications that rely on asynchronous I/O or real-time data processing.
## How to write an asynchronous generator
An asynchronous generator is a special kind of coroutine that allows you to yield values over time using yield, while being awaited with async for. It's ideal for producing a sequence of asynchronous results, such as reading from a stream or fetching data in chunks.
## How to use async comprehensions
Async comprehensions are like regular list comprehensions, but they work with asynchronous iterables. They're useful when you want to collect items from an async source into a list or another collection efficiently and succinctly.
## Type-annotate generators
Type annotations improve code clarity by specifying what kind of values a generator will produce.
