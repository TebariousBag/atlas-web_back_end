# Caching Systems Project

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following caching concepts without external help:

### General Concepts

- What a **caching system** is
- The purpose of a **caching system**
- The **limitations** of caching systems

### Caching Algorithms

- **FIFO**: First-In, First-Out
- **LIFO**: Last-In, First-Out
- **LRU**: Least Recently Used
- **MRU**: Most Recently Used
- **LFU**: Least Frequently Used

## Project Overview

This project involves implementing and understanding different caching strategies commonly used in software development and system design. Each caching strategy has its own use case and performance trade-offs. The goal is to understand their behavior and when to use them.

## Why Caching Matters

Caching helps optimize performance by storing frequently accessed data closer to the user or system that needs it. It reduces latency and load, especially in web applications, APIs, and databases.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.9
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Custom classes for each caching strategy

## Testing

Basic unit tests are included to demonstrate the behavior of each caching method.
