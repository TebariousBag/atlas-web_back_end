# Python - Variable Annotations
## Overview
This project focuses on using type annotations in Python 3. We learn how to write clear, type-safe functions and variables, explore duck typing, and validate type correctness using tools like mypy.
## Type Annotations
This is the first time I've been introduced to type annotations. Type annotations in Python 3 are optional hints that help document your code and enable static type checking tools like mypy. They were introduced in Python 3.5 through PEP 484 and have become increasingly powerful with each release.
## Mypy
We are also introduced to mypy. When used with type annotations it helps catch type-related bugs before runtime. It adds optional static typing to Python, allowing developers to maintain Python's flexibility while gaining the benefits of compile-time type checking.
## Duck Typing
Duck typing is a fundamental concept in Python where objects are treated based on what they can do rather than what they are. As the saying goes: "If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck". This means Python doesn't care about an object's actual class or type; all that matters is whether it has the methods and attributes needed for a particular operation.
## Conclusion
I learned a lot in this project, it seemed a little overwhelming initially because we have been focused on web front-end for so long. But after getting into it it started to click. I can see how type annotations can be very useful.
