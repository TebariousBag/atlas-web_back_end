# Python - Async
## Overview
This project implements various aspects of Python's asynchronous programming features using the asyncio library. It covers fundamental concepts of async/await syntax, concurrent execution, and task management.
## Using async and await in Python
Python introduced native support for asynchronous programming in version 3.5 using the async and await syntax. This allows you to write asynchronous code that is non-blocking and more readable, especially when dealing with I/O-bound tasks like web requests, file operations, or timers.
### What is Asynchronous Programming?
Asynchronous programming allows multiple operations to run concurrently (not necessarily in parallel), so that your program can keep working while waiting for some operations to complete (like sleeping, downloading data, etc.).

Instead of blocking the entire program (like time.sleep() would), async code pauses and lets other tasks run while waiting.
### The async Keyword
The async keyword is used to define a coroutine, which is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed.
### The await Keyword
The await keyword is used inside an async function to pause execution until the awaited coroutine completes.
## Overview
This project explores the fundamentals of asynchronous programming in Python using the async and await syntax. Through a series of coroutine-based tasks, it demonstrates how to write non-blocking, concurrent code using the asyncio library. Key concepts include defining asynchronous functions, running multiple coroutines concurrently, creating asyncio tasks, and measuring execution time. This hands-on approach provides a practical understanding of asynchronous execution patterns and is ideal for building efficient, I/O-bound Python applications.
