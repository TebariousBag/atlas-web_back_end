# ES6 Promises
## Overview
In this project we are learning more about JavaScript, mainly focusing on Promises. A Promise is an asynchronous operation that will eventually complete (or fail). It's essentially a placeholder for a value that might not be available yet.
## States of Promises
Promises have three states:
* Pending: starting state
* Fulfilled: success or resolved
* Rejected: failed or rejected
## Promise Methods
We learned about different methods in this project.
.then(): Handles successful promise resolution
.catch(): Handles errors and rejections
.finally(): Executes regardless of success or failure
## Conclusion
This project was really helpful on how to use Promises and why they are useful. It's kind of like ordering a three course meal. You put the order in at once, and the cooks start making it. And Each course comes out when its ready. You can eat when it arrives and the cooks continue working on the rest.
