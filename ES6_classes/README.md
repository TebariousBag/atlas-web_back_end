# ES6 Classes
## Project Overview
This project covers fundamental concepts in modern JavaScript focusing on classes, inheritance, and metaprogramming. Through hands-on exercises, you'll master object-oriented programming principles and advanced JavaScript features.
## Core Concepts Covered
### 1. Defining Classes
Classes in JavaScript are templates for creating objects. They encapsulate properties and behaviors, promoting organized and reusable code. Key aspects covered:

* Class declaration syntax
* Constructor initialization
* Property definition
* Instance creation

### 2. Adding Methods
Methods are functions attached to classes that operate on class instances. Topics include:

* Instance method creation
* Method binding and context
* Method inheritance
* Method overriding

### 3. Static Methods
Static methods belong to the class itself rather than instances. Learning outcomes:

* Purpose of static methods
* Implementation patterns
* Utility method organization
* Factory pattern applications

### 4. Class Extension
Understanding inheritance through class extension enables code reuse and specialization. Topics covered:

* Extending existing classes
* Superclass method calls
* Property inheritance
* Method overriding

### 5. Metaprogramming and Symbols
Advanced JavaScript features for manipulating code programmatically:

* Symbol basics
* Private members
* Dynamic property manipulation
* Class modification techniques
