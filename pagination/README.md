# Pagination

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts clearly and without relying on external references:

### Pagination Techniques

- How to paginate a dataset using simple `page` and `page_size` parameters
- How to implement pagination with hypermedia metadata
- How to design a deletion-resilient pagination system

## Project Overview

This project focuses on different methods of paginating large datasets efficiently. It covers both traditional pagination approaches and more advanced techniques that handle edge cases like data deletion. The goal is to build a solid understanding of pagination logic and its practical implementation in web applications.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.9
- Flask (if used for API serving)
- Basic file I/O and dataset handling
- REST API principles (if applicable)
