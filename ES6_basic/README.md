# ES6 Basics
## Overview
In this project we take our first look at JavaScript. ES6, officially known as ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth edition of JavaScript's standard specification.
## Variables
We learned two new variables, const and let. 
* const - is a keyword in JavaScript introduced in ES6 that allows you to declare constants. Unlike regular variables, constants cannot be reassigned after they're declared.
* let - is a keyword introduced in ES6 that creates block-scoped variables. Unlike var, which is function-scoped, let creates variables that are confined to their nearest block (any code enclosed in curly braces {}).
## Overview
There was a lot in this project since it was the first experience with JavaScript. This covered the basic fundamentals as an introduction.
